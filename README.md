# Today I Learned, a small but cute, React app 



This little app is an exercise to retake and update my knowledge of ReactJS.

I wanted to make an app that was highly scalable, in the next version I will add a sing up so that only registered users can add facts, among many other developments that can improve the user experience.

It has also served as an excuse to use Supabase to create my backend and Netlify to do the deployment.
